# 🧠 Learning Vault

Welcome to my personal **Learning Vault** — a continuously evolving repository where I document my journey of learning new technologies, programming languages, frameworks, and tools.

## 🚀 Purpose

This repository serves as:

- A **learning diary** for tracking my progress.
- A place to **experiment** with code snippets and small projects.
- A **reference hub** for the future.
- A public showcase of what I'm currently exploring.

## 🗂️ Structure

> Each folder contains:
> - Notes or Markdown summaries
> - Hands-on examples
> - Mini-projects or exercises

## 📚 Topics on My Radar

- 🔤 Programming Languages (Python, JS, Rust, Go, etc.)
- 🌐 Web Development (React, Next.js, Flask, etc.)
- 🐳 DevOps & Infra (Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, Terraform)
- ☁️ Cloud Platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- 🔐 Security Concepts (DevSecOps, IAM, etc.)
- 📈 Data & Visualization (SQL, Pandas, Matplotlib)

## ✅ Goals

- Learn by **doing** — not just watching tutorials.
- Keep my notes clean and **reusable**.
- Share what I learn in **bite-sized commits**.
- Build a solid **foundation** for future projects and interviews.

## 📌 Notes

- This repo is under active development.
- Some folders may be incomplete or messy — learning is not always linear.
- Contributions or suggestions are welcome if you’re on a similar path! 😊
